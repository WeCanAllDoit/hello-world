# hello-world

fun times learning new stuff

I am a serial starter of projects and have issues completeting undefined tasks as there are just TOO many squriels, rabbit holes and other interesting things that vye for my attention. I have learned though that if I start with a list, I am much more likely to complete a Short list rather easily. This is a challenge when I do not know what to put on the list but hey that is another string to pull at later.
